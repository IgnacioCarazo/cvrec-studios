              Charlotta Roos, the founder of CVRec Studios, is a 28-year old
              self-taught female videographer and photographer based in
              Helsinki, Finland, but working worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by a passion for intertwining sound and motion in various
              forms, she also creates a safe space for her subjects to share
              their own story, whether itâ€™s through videography or photography.
              Her work not only captures the essence of movement, but also
              empowers her subjects to express their true selves.
            </p>
            <p>Welcome to her portfolio.</p>
